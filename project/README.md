# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis  
### Google Data Analytics Capstone Project (Excel)

## 📌 Project Summary
This project analyzes **12 months of Cyclistic bike-share data** to understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** use the service differently. The goal is to uncover behavioral patterns and provide **data-driven recommendations** to help Cyclistic increase annual memberships.

Using **Excel and Google Sheets**, I cleaned, combined, and explored over **5 million rows** of ride data. I created calculated fields, built PivotTables, and designed visualizations to compare ride duration, weekly usage patterns, seasonal trends, and bike type preferences across rider groups.
